## Privacy

<h5 style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>Last updated November 26, 2020</h5>

<span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold', color: 'gray' }}>We respect your privacy. We do not sell any of your personal information to third parties. We only store data required for the core functionality of the Extension and any additional features you have enabled.</span>

This document details what data we collect from you when you use our Extension, and how and why we use it. _Extension refers to the [Simply Synonyms Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simply-synonyms/hapeijdlgbbhjmijhmgggnakcgdcpfap)._

### 1. What information do we collect?

**As of V0.3.0**: The Simply Synonyms backend runs on Google Firebase. Google Firebase provides hosting for our API, which your browser sends a request to in order to look up synonyms, etc. Google Firebase also provides identity and authentication management. Google Firebase may log your IP address and other request data (such as the word when requesting synonyms). We only use this data to provide synonym and word data for our Extension, as well as other core functionality. If you do not sign in to the Extension, we will not store any of your personal information other than temporary request logs.

We also use Mailgun for sending and managing emails. If you sign in to the Extension, we will share your email, name and subscription information with Mailgun solely for the purpose of sending you emails. You may unsubscribe from these emails at any time.

Our Extension requires permission to access and change data on all websites, as well as permission to interact with tabs. These permissions only enable core functionality. The Extension does not collect your browsing history or tab information, and does not interfere with your tabs or webpages.

We do not collect any additional information.
