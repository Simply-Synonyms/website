  Simply Synonyms is a thesaurus extension for Google Chrome. It's designed to help you find synonyms, antonyms and more as fast as possible without getting in your way. It's perfect for improving your vocabulary, or writing better emails, etc. To use, simply double-click any word on any page or access the quick search and other features from the extension popup.

  As well as the core synonym functionality, we're also working on some cool additional features. For example, if you sign in with your Google account we'll send you an optional email each week with your weekly synonym stats, useful words, and more.

  It's also open source, meaning anyone who knows how to code can contribute to it or view the upcoming features
